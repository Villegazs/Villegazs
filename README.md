# 💫 About Me:
I am a Digital Entertainment Design Engineer passionate about bridging the gap between intuitive user experiences and robust back-end architecture. My focus is on creating polished, player-first games by combining thoughtful UX design with clean, scalable C# code in Unity. I thrive on solving complex problems, whether it's designing a seamless UI flow or re-architecting a codebase for multiplayer.<br><br>🔭 I’m currently working on: Polishing my game development portfolio with in-depth case studies and developing personal projects focused on UI systems and multiplayer networking.<br><br>🌱 I’m currently learning: Advanced C# design patterns for scalable game architecture and best practices for AAA game development pipelines.<br><br>👯 I’m looking to collaborate on: Game jams or indie projects where I can contribute to creating an exceptional user experience.<br><br>💬 Ask me about: UI/UX design & implementation in Unity, refactoring code for multiplayer, bridging design (Figma) with engineering (Unity), or anything related to VALORANT's game design!<br><br>⚡ Fun fact: When I'm not coding, you'll likely find me climbing the ranks in VALORANT or analyzing gameplay from a competitive player's perspective. It's my favorite way to study game design
